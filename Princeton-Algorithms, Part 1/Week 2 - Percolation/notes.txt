Quick find
Quadratic equasions, like 'Quick Find' are when. for example, int id[18] requires for each index to find a matching index
if you use a regular 'for' loop it means every point is touched a squared amount of times.
this is a quadratic equasion and it is the slowest algorithim as it checks ALL indexes x the amopunt of indexes there are or id[] x id[]
for large datasets Quadratic equasions are too slow.
