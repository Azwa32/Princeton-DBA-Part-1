Quick find
Quadratic equasions, like 'Quick Find' are when. for example, int id[18] requires for each index to find a matching index
if you use a regular 'for' loop it means every point is touched a squared amount of times.
this is a quadratic equasion and it is the slowest algorithim as it checks ALL indexes x the amopunt of indexes there are or id[] x id[]
for large datasets Quadratic equasions are too slow.

Quick Union
Quick union associates different data with one-another in a linked list form, where every unit holds the data + the next unit it links to.
the avearge of accessing this data set is quicker than Quick Find but where a node of linked sets is = to N it still has to access every data point so it 'can' be too slow.

Quick Union Improvements
To improve upon Quick Union we ensure the tree from Quick Union does not get too tall. The improvement keeps track of the number of objects in each tree and balances by linking the root of a smaller tree to the root of a larger tree (aka union by height or "rank".
